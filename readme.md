A set of functions that allows for high-repetition simulation of two AIs playing the card game "Briscola". Only uses the Python built-in modules.

AIs are located in AI.py, along with necessary methods per AI class.
A quick demonstration of how to use the main simulation function can be found in simulation.py.
