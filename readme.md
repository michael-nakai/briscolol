A set of functions that allows for high-repetition simulation of two AIs playing the card game "Briscola". Uses the Python built-in modules along with scipy, numpy, and pandas.

AIs are located in AI.py, along with necessary methods per AI class.

A quick demonstration of how to use the main simulation function can be found in test.py.
